# Species Distribution Modeling of the Beetle _A. tumida_

_Aetina tumida_ is an invasive beetle species that is a parasite on the honey bee, _Apis melifera_. Its original home is South Africa. It has already appeared in U.S.A. and parts of Europe (Italy). We are trying to model its future distribution using MaxEnt environmental niche modeling.

Factors that may influence its growth:
- soil moisture (>50%)
- soil temperature (>12 градуса)

We have compiled occurrsence data in the `samples` folder. Sources: Italian databases, GBIF.

We have compiled environmental data in the `environmental-layers` folder. We have the 12 bioclimatic variables from htttp://bioclim.org and we also have soil moisture data downloaded form the European Space Agency (ESA).
