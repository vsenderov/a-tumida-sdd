<title>Maxent model for aetina_tumida</title>
<CENTER><H1>Maxent model for aetina_tumida</H1></CENTER>
<br> This page contains some analysis of the Maxent model for aetina_tumida, created Tue Aug 20 18:21:24 CEST 2019 using Maxent version 3.4.1.  If you would like to do further analyses, the raw data used here is linked to at the end of this page.<br>
<br><HR><H2>Analysis of omission/commission</H2>
The following picture shows the omission rate and predicted area as a function of the cumulative threshold.  The omission rate is is calculated both on the training presence records, and (if test data are used) on the test records.  The omission rate should be close to the predicted omission, because of the definition of the cumulative threshold.

<br> The next picture is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the same data.  Note that the specificity is defined using predicted area, rather than true commission (see the paper by Phillips, Anderson and Schapire cited on the help page for discussion of what this means).  This implies that the maximum achievable AUC is less than 1.  If test data is drawn from the Maxent distribution itself, then the maximum possible test AUC would be 0.854 rather than 1; in practice the test AUC may exceed this bound.

Some common thresholds and corresponding omission rates are as follows.  If test data are available, binomial probabilities are calculated exactly if the number of test samples is at most 25, otherwise using a normal approximation to the binomial.  These are 1-sided p-values for the null hypothesis that test points are predicted no better than by a random prediction with the same fractional predicted area.  The "Balance" threshold minimizes 6 * training omission rate + .04 * cumulative threshold + 1.6 * fractional predicted area.<br>

<br><HR><H2>Analysis of variable contributions</H2><br>
The following table gives estimates of relative contributions of the environmental variables to the Maxent model.  To determine the first estimate, in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable, or subtracted from it if the change to the absolute value of lambda is negative.  For the second estimate, for each environmental variable in turn, the values of that variable on training presence and background data are randomly permuted.  The model is reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown in the table, normalized to percentages.  As with the variable jackknife, variable contributions should be interpreted with caution when the predictor variables are correlated.<br>
<br><table border cols=3><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Percent contribution</th><th>Permutation importance</th><tr align=right><td>bioclim_1</td><td>43.7</td><td>11.6</td></tr><tr align=right><td>soil-mean</td><td>25.5</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr align=right><td>bioclim_5</td><td>21.8</td><td>42.1</td></tr><tr align=right><td>bioclim_6</td><td>5.2</td><td>19.3</td></tr><tr align=right><td>soil-min</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr align=right><td>soil-max</td><td>1</td><td>1.2</td></tr></table><br><br>
The following picture shows the results of the jackknife test of variable importance.  The environmental variable with highest gain when used in isolation is bioclim_5, which therefore appears to have the most useful information by itself.  The environmental variable that decreases the gain the most when it is omitted is bioclim_5, which therefore appears to have the most information that isn't present in the other variables.<br>
